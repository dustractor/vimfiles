# vim-folder


aka vimfiles aka the place where my vimrc lives

(note to anyone trying this at home)

* Step 1: Git has to be installed of frickin course  

* Step 2: After unzip or clone, vim dash folder is not a thing vim looks for (to find vimrc). Rename to vimfiles and put in user home folder.  

* Step 3: There has to be a folder in home named .vimtemp unless you modify that part accordingly.  

* Step 4: Open vim and run :PlugInstall

Restart vim and now for whatever reason, your vim is set up like mine. I'm a lazy ass, so it's not like it's going to be any good.  It's just an example of a random person's config out there on the internet. Take care.
